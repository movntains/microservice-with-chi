  Update a specific order by its ID.

  To get an ID, run the `List All Orders` request and grab an order ID from the response. Then update the URL of this request to use that order ID.

  The `status` of the request body can be either `shipped` or `completed`.

  A `400 Bad Request` is expected if:

  - Setting `status` to `shipped` for an order that has already been shipped (i.e., `shipped_at` is not `null`)
  - Setting `status` to `completed` for an order that has already been completed (i.e., `completed_at` is not `null`)
  - Setting `status` to `completed` for an order that has not yet been shipped (i.e., `shipped_at` is `null`)
